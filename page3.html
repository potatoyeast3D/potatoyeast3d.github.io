            <h1>Saketh Likes</h1>
            <p>
                Saketh loves to make things quickly, this is because of his impatient nature. It is because of that he likes to streamline processes in blender. He also wants to do metal or woodworking, but his lack of experience makes this too dangerous. His low dexterity makes it hard for him to make small or good things. This means whenever he <i>does</i>
                get to woodwork he makes really poor quality objects. Saketh also likes to play <b>Kerbal Space Program</b>
                because he loves space and automatically becauses more patient while playing it.

            <h2>Saketh's Dislikes</h2>
            <p>
                Saketh is not a fan of things that take a while, because he is too impatient. This impatience is why working with networks becomes hard for him, something always goes wrong. He is not a fan of hurting himself. He is not emo. Saketh is also not a fan of trying to get hardware and software to correctly interact. This is why his raspberry pi usually sits dormant in his room. An exeption to this rule is his computer. Saketh loves his computer no matter what. This is also the reason he has trouble programming for long periods of time, with experience he will not be so impatient and he'll have more skill to program.

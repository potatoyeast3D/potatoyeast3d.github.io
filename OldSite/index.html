            <h1>About Saketh</h1>
            <p>
                Saketh is 14 years old. He likes computers so much built one. He has a little programming experience in Python, Java, CSS, and HTML. He likes to read outdoors or think for long periods of time about a specific thing. He also uses blender in his free time. The only award of considerable value that he won was a medal for 5th palace in the science olympiad regional event. He wants to become a nuclear engineer as he likes physics and wants to create something that can help the environment. Nuclear engineering is a good option to him because of the power managment orientation it has. It can even require an intelligently disigned reactor core as to not fail under stress.

            <h2>Saketh's Website</h2>
            <p>
                Saketh recenty just built a website at <a href="www.sakethk.com">www.sakethk.com</a>. This website has just been built and Saketh doesn't really know what he's doing when he tries to maintain its security. He is inexperienced in understanding how websites work. Saketh's website has few plans due to the relativley uninteresting life he leads. The site could potentially be somewhere his raspberry pi outputs data to. For example, the raspberry pi was used to process data, the output could be to the website. Saketh's website is likley to use php but dynamic websites take up server side processing and my skills do not justify the use of that power.
